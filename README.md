### Greetings, üëã

I'm Lee SeungHwan, also known as Ethan or Ïù¥Ïç¨.

I'm a driven Web Developer with a passion for imagination and curiosity.

I hope to contribute to creating a more user-friendly and delightful world<br/>
through technology that has the power to touch people's hearts.

I continuously explore technologies and trends,<br/>
and strive to develop solutions that meet user's needs and exceed their expectations.

I feel greate pleasure in collaborating with design, marketing and the other teams <br/>
to work out solutions together.

By combining our diverse perspectives and skill sets,<br/>
we can create innovative and effective solutions<br/>
that truly resonate with our users.

I believe that this collaborative approach <br/>
not only results in better outcomes but also fosters a positive team culture <br/>
and strengthens our relationships with users.

Maybe we'll have time to talk sometime.
